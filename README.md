# Equation File Browser Interface Using Data Structure (Stack)

This project reads from multiple files, extracting two types of information:
1) equations
2) file name

The contents of these files are then written to an XML file.

On the equation side, the input contains infix expressions,
which are then converted to postfix.

The program also checks whether the equation is balanced or invalid.

## Note that there is app_photo folder.
